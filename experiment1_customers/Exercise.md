# Exercise: Insurance Contracts 

Given a list of customers and existing insurance contracts given by the CSV files `customers.csv` and `contracts.csv`
respectively, located in the `data/` folder, with the corresponding schemas located in `schema/`.
Management wants you:
- identity the customers, who do not yet have a contract for any insurance product (potential targets for marketing campaign)
- find all inconsistencies in the data sets, i.e. it has been observed that some customers have registered phone numbers and/or email addresses 
in the customer-relationship management system and the contract management system.
