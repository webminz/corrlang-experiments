abstract = {Our vision paper outlines a plan to improve the future of semantic interoperability in data spaces through the application of machine learning. The use of data spaces, where data is exchanged among members in a self-regulated environment, is becoming increasingly popular. However, the current manual practices of managing metadata and vocabularies in these spaces are time-consuming, prone to errors, and may not meet the needs of all stakeholders. By leveraging the power of machine learning, we believe that semantic interoperability in data spaces can be significantly improved. This involves automatically generating and updating metadata, which results in a more flexible vocabulary that can accommodate the diverse terminologies used by different sub-communities. Our vision for the future of data spaces addresses the limitations of conventional data exchange and makes data more accessible and valuable for all members of the community.},

abstract = {The legislative landscape, characterized by overwhelming amounts of legal data which, on many occasions, is only accessible by legal experts, the fragmented nature of information and the ever-increasing number of disparate systems, have given more impetus to the interoperability realm of legal data. The semantic interoperability of Linked Open Legal Data (LOLD) requires rich and well-defined metadata, as well as the establishment of standards, in order to be able to connect and link these scattered legal data resources. This is usually achieved through the transformation of legal information into structured format and through the utilization of legal ontologies whose main purpose is to connect the legal basis of two or more countries by allowing for reusability and the ability to adequately represent legal information, which is understood and retrieved across borders. Within the context of this study, the European Legislation Identifier (ELI) and Akoma Ntoso (AKN) ontologies are mapped in order to make legal data compatible and reusable in as many contexts as possible and to support the Linked Open Legal Data (LOLD) concept. The mapping of these two widely used legal ontologies was evaluated by domain experts and strongly validated by tools. The usefulness of the produced mapping is proven through its real-life context application, although one thing to consider regarding possible future perspectives, could be the inclusion and mapping of more legal ontologies to expand the application domain and improve the semantic interoperability of legal information. These mappings could be either achieved using similar methodological approaches or applications of automated and AI-based ontology mapping techniques.},

abstract = {Digital twin technology establishes the future development vision for Industry 4.0, and is also an important exploration direction for the Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) paradigm. Because it builds a more flexible and communicative production system through models that spans life cycle, hierarchy and architecture. The standard proposed under the concept of Industry 4.0, the Asset Administration Shell (AAS), provides a syntactic interoperability interface for all assets involved in smart factories. However, there is still a need to fill the gap regarding semantic interoperability, in order to allow efficient interactions between Industry 4.0 components. Ontologies are a good candidate because they provide formal semantics expressed using a knowledge representation language, and in addition, there are many associated mature tools for reasoning and inference. Therefore, we propose a modeling approach that provides semantic interoperability for AAS-based digital twins using ontologies.},

Studies to provide interoperability between systems have been focused on computational architectures, including conceptual models and implementations. In this work, a novel proposed architecture is presented. It is based on paradigms like Polystores and Ontology-based Data Access (OBDA), and streaming data processing over micro-services. Also, an implementation of the proposed architecture was developed. Finally, the approach was evaluated over a case study that integrates engineering data from different data sources in the oil and gas industry context.},

abstract = {This paper demonstrates a proof of concept for cross-border information exchange guided by the single digital gateway regulation (SDGR) and once-only principle (OOP). The research systematically investigates the challenges and limitations of existing solutions for semantic interoperability. Furthermore, the concept of canonical evidence is introduced as a tool for the cross-border exchange of structured data automatically with less ambiguity and in compliance with the legal requirements of the selected public services. A design science research approach in an agile set-up is applied in the artefact (canonical evidences) development process. The requirements are elicited based on eight case studies set up in the context of the EU initiative, Digital Europe for all (De4a). The data models developed in this study are in compliance with the requirements and provisions of a selected set of EU member states. The outcome of the study includes eleven evidence types that could be reusable in executing procedures of respective e-Government services.},

abstract = {Descriptive and empirical sciences, such as History, are the sciences that collect, observe and describe phenomena to explain them and draw interpretative conclusions about influences, driving forces and impacts under given circumstances. Spreadsheet software and relational database management systems are still the dominant tools for quantitative analysis and overall data management in these these sciences, allowing researchers to directly analyse the gathered data and perform scholarly interpretation. However, this current practice has a set of limitations, including the high dependency of the collected data on the initial research hypothesis, usually useless for other research, the lack of representation of the details from which the registered relations are inferred, and the difficulty to revisit the original data sources for verification, corrections or improvements. To cope with these problems, in this article we present FAST&nbsp;CAT, a collaborative system for assistive data entry and curation in Digital Humanities and similar forms of empirical research. We describe the related challenges, the overall methodology we follow for supporting semantic interoperability, and discuss the use of FAST&nbsp;CAT in the context of a European (ERC) project of Maritime History, called SeaLiT, which examines economic, social and demographic impacts of the introduction of steamboats in the Mediterranean area between the 1850s and the 1920s.},

abstract = {The growing use of Internet of Things (IoT) technology within the healthcare system has created vast, heterogeneous data sets that are generated from wearable sensors, smart monitoring devices, and medical records. The lack of semantic interoperability among the vast diversity of these data sources represents one of the largest challenges because of format differences, domain-specific standards, and context differences. Scalability, flexibility, and inefficiency of the knowledge extraction process limit current solutions to provide worthwhile efficacy in large-scale IoT-healthcare systems. This research proposes a Unified Semantic Framework for interoperability and converting diverse healthcare and IoT data into semantically homogeneous, machine-understandable, structured forms. The ontologies are used in this framework to enable SPARQL querying as well as context data enrichment of information for interoperability within a domain. In contrast to common methods based on static relational schema and manually designed features, the approach enhances knowledge discovery and data consistency and enables scalable predictive analytics for IoT-based healthcare applications. The efficacy of this approach is depicted with conceptual modeling and implemented case scenarios and showcases scalable data integration capability, intelligent decision support, and effective query. With the addition of a graph-based semantic layer, the framework provides a foundation for high-end machine learning-enabled analysis in IoT and health informatics environments.},

abstract = {The development of ecosystems around open government data in order to generate social and economic value from them requires on one hand the existence of a critical mass of them and on the other hand some level of homogeneity and interoperability among the numerous portals and websites providing them which enables their combined exploitation. This paper presents the Technical, Semantic, Legal, and Organizational (TSLO) Interoperability Framework, a conceptual tool designed to provide a structured evaluation of the interoperability capabilities of open government data infrastructures. It incorporates the technical, semantic, legal, and organizational aspects of open government data provision, which are crucial for developing interoperability between open data portals and websites, which enables the generation of high levels of social and economic value from them, so it can pave the way for creating open data ecosystems for this purpose. We are then applying this TSLO framework to examine from this perspective the open data infrastructures of the Greek local government administration institutions of all three layers of it (decentralized, regional, and municipal). In particular, we examine the open government data portals and websites of the local Greek governments and provide a detailed analysis of them concerning the fore aspects of the framework. This first application of TSLO reveals not only the low participation of Greek local government institutions in the open data movement, and especially of the municipalities, where only 8 out of 332 municipalities provide open data on their portals or websites but also the inconsistent implementation of this, especially with respect to the use of semantic technologies as well as the legal frameworks under which the open data provided. Finally, we propose the automation of the TSLO framework to facilitate the evaluation and standardization of open local government data infrastructure and expand the study to identify and address barriers to open data provision.},

abstract = {Programs are rarely implemented in a single language, and thus questions of type soundness should address not only the semantics of a single language, but how it interacts with others. Even between type-safe languages, disparate features can frustrate interoperability, as invariants from one language can easily be violated in the other. In their seminal 2007 paper, Matthews and Findler proposed a multi-language construction that augments the interoperating languages with a pair of boundaries that allow code from one language to be embedded in the other. While this technique has been widely applied, their syntactic source-level interoperability doesn’t reflect practical implementations, where the behavior of interaction is only defined after compilation to a common target, and any safety must be ensured by target invariants or inserted target-level “glue code.” In this paper, we present a novel framework for the design and verification of sound language interoperability that follows an interoperation-after-compilation strategy. Language designers specify what data can be converted between types of the two languages via a convertibility relation τA ∼ τB (“τA is convertible to τB”) and specify target-level glue code implementing the conversions. Then, by giving a semantic model of source-language types as sets of target-language terms, they can establish not only the meaning of the source types, but also soundness of conversions: i.e., whenever τA ∼ τB, the corresponding pair of conversions (glue code) convert target terms that behave like τA to target terms that behave like τB, and vice versa. With this, they can prove semantic type soundness for the entire system. We illustrate our framework via a series of case studies that demonstrate how our semantic interoperation-after-compilation approach allows us both to account for complex differences in language semantics and make efficiency trade-offs based on particularities of compilers or targets.},

Since resource-oriented architectures align well with the WoT architectures, RESTful services have been the go-to interface to expose the connected devices on the Web. However, the heterogeneity of descriptions of devices and services as well as underlying IoT-level protocols has led to a number of interoperability issues. Recently, the growing popularity of semantically-enabled services has led to the emergence of services described with and exchanging RDF. In this position paper, we attempt to frame the challenges encountered in enabling semantic interoperability of heterogeneous WoT services, with the help of a real world production line scenario. We also propose preliminary solutions to the main issues hampering the establishment of true semantic interoperability on the WoT.},
