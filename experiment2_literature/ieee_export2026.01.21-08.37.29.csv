It has been proposed to provide a consistent API for the HL7v3 CDA. However, the core issues of HL7v3 are not solved at the API level. The community around the project are proposing the adoption of RDF technologies to overcome the current challenges in interoperating with linked data. However, RDF triples nor ontologies provide semantic interoperability by themselves, a more robust information infrastructure, such as the Multilevel Model-Driven (MMD) approach, is required. An XML implementation of the MMD was used to model the FHIR Schemas as Domain Models (DMs) against a generic Reference Model (RM) to provide syntactic validation. RDF triples were included in the domain models to provide missing semantics. The XML data instances were validated against their Domain Models. The DMs do not create any new types, they only express constraints of the RM types, this provides consistent query and data analysis capability across all DMs. RDF triples were extracted from the DMs and added to a triple store graph with the RM ontology. The XML data is also expressed as Literals in the graph. This study shows the feasibility of using MMD solutions to provide full operational semantic interoperability for the FHIR ecosystem.","","978-1-4673-9548-9","10.1109/ICHI.2015.74","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7349736","Health information systems;Information exchange;Health Level 7","Semantics;Medical services;Resource description framework;XML;Interoperability;Data models;Charge coupled devices","","14","","12","IEEE","10 Dec 2015","21-23 Oct. 2015","21-23 Oct. 2015","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To overcome this restriction, many issues from a hardware or software view must be resolved.

The semantics of virtual worlds and virtual entities is described using the Influence/Reaction model of multi-agent systems. The main feature of this model is to clearly separate the description of an action (performed by virtual entities) and the consequences of the action. We demonstrate how this separation is highly favourable to design virtual worlds with interoperability. We use and extend the Influence/Reaction model to quantify the semantic compatibility level between virtual worlds and then to compute the resulting behavior of virtual entities involved in an interoperability session. Nevertheless, the Influence/Reaction model can work properly for interoperability purposes only if the symbols (names) used to describe the virtual entities are identical in each virtual world. This constraint is relaxed by using the ontology concept.","","0-8186-7967-0","10.1109/ENABL.1997.630810","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=630810","","Protocols;Ontologies;Humans;Virtual reality;Hardware;TCPIP;Application software;Virtual environment","","5","","9","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","18-20 June 1997","18-20 June 1997","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The Device Observation Reporter (DOR) described in this work is a gateway that connects these realms.

Upon completion, the signals descriptions and values are transformed to Health Level Seven version 2 messages and sent to a hospital information system/electronic health record system within the clinical IT network. The successful integration of device data for documentation and usage in clinical information systems can further leverage the novel device communication standard proposals.

In such circumstances, it is essential to understand the meaning and interpretation of various contexts in different business domains and to align context ontologies together. Our investigations reveal that existing works poorly address these requirements. To fill this gap, this paper proposes the Ontology as a Service (OaaS) approach to facilitate the semantic interoperability of context-aware systems. In the proposed solution, the complexities of semantic interoperability are resolved and handled by a standalone ontology service, which can be easily reused and consumed by different ontology service consumers and brokers. The proposed ontology service includes several ontology repositories, a web service that positions a context concept in the existing ontologies and another web service that maps the relationship between existing context concepts. We evaluated our approach with a case study that resolves three semantic differences between two IoT applications originating from heterogeneous domains of smart home and health environments.","","979-8-3503-3819-5","10.1109/CSICC58665.2023.10105364","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10105364","Ontology;Ontology as a Service;Semantic Interoperability;Context-Aware Systems","Web services;Semantics;Smart homes;Ontologies;Software;Complexity theory;Internet of Things","","5","","17","IEEE","26 Apr 2023","25-26 Jan. 2023","25-26 Jan. 2023","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is for this reason that the semantic and interoperable Web service registry & repository (R&R) model based on ontology is proposed. Based on ISO SC32 19763-3: MFI4OR (metamodel framework for interoperability: metamodel for ontology registration) we build a reference ontology (RO) of Web service and local ontologies (LOs) that evolve from RO. Whatever RO or LO, they all could be regarded as the registry schema of different Web service R&R models. It is more important that ontology evolution rules should be defined when LO evolves from RO and evolution information is to be recorded for the semantic consistency between the RO and LO, which help to enhance the ontology-based semantic interoperability between the different R&R models. Finally, a model of prototype system based on these methods is introduced.","2160-4916","978-0-7695-3449-7","10.1109/GCC.2008.15","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4662946","MFI;Web service registry and repository model;Reference ontology;Local ontology","Web services;Ontologies;Laboratories;Software engineering;ISO standards;Prototypes;Grid computing;Helium;Educational institutions;Mathematics","","5","","9","IEEE","31 Oct 2008","24-26 Oct. 2008","24-26 Oct. 2008","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Semantic resolution between the RDBSs is extremely difficult to address mainly because participating RDBSs are designed and built independently. Furthermore, individual RDBSs are likely to evolve over time and the changes must be reconciled dynamically. In this paper, we describe an approach to resolve the semantic conflicts between RDBSs automatically while allowing the individual RDBSs to evolve. Relational database ontology (RDBO) is created and used to ensure the semantic descriptions of the individual RDBSs are conformed to a set of vocabularies, structures, and restrictions. We show how a modified reasoning engine is used to validate and infer additional semantic relationships from the existing relationships. We also show how terms defined in different database ontologies are compared to each other semantically using semantic weights and our modified reasoning engine. As a result, RDBSs can intemperate with each other seamlessly and at the correct level of semantics defined in their ontologies.","1098-8068","978-0-7695-2947-9","10.1109/IDEAS.2007.4318106","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4318106","","Relational databases;Ontologies;Engines;OWL;Deductive databases;Computer science;Vocabulary;Semantic Web;Large-scale systems;Data engineering","","4","1","19","IEEE","24 Sep 2007","6-8 Sept. 2007","6-8 Sept. 2007","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Software agents have been realized as pivotal technology to drive semantic Web and grid services ultimately leading to automation of e-Science, e-Health and e-Commerce applications. Ontologies play a vital role as source of semantic representation of Web services, grid services and agent services. Different ontology languages have been proposed for semantic representation of these technologies. OWL is W3C standard for description of services on web and grid while FIPA SL is used as semantic language in agents. Both semantic languages differ in terms, syntax and semantics. We proposed software agent driven system architecture i.e.middleware ontology service (MOS) which provide translation of ontologies between these two languages. At the end, we provide comparative study of MOS with previous developed system i.e. ontology gateway and describe its implementation and results.","","978-0-7695-3496-1","10.1109/WIIAT.2008.315","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4740614","Software Agents;Semantic Web Services;Semantic grid;Semantic Interoperability","Software agents;Ontologies;Semantic Web;Web services;Intelligent agent;OWL;Service oriented architecture;Grid computing;Multiagent systems;Computer science","","4","","12","IEEE","6 Jan 2009","9-12 Dec. 2008","9-12 Dec. 2008","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An aggregator utilizing several types of resources is therefore potentially faced with a problem of semantic interoperability. This paper addresses this challenge by presenting a testbed consisting of a microgrid model integrated with several controllers communicating with industrial grade protocols for demand response, including IEC 61850, OpenChargePoint protocol (OCPP), OpenADR and UDP.

Hence, capturing and formally representing this cross-domain knowledge is vital for next generation health information systems (HIS) to become interoperable and perform decision support tasks. To this end, ontologies have been increasingly used in HIS for representing domain knowledge; but since no comprehensive ontology relevant to both the medical and oral health domains exists no knowledge base exists either. In this paper, we present our work on addressing this issue by building an Oral-Systemic Health Cross-domain Ontology (OSHCO) to capture the inter-dependent conditions across both the domains.

However, interoperability among collaborating participants is hard to tackle in the interaction between business and IT problem domains during EIS integration process. The integration of EIS needs to be considered from an architectural point of view on issues around business, organization and information technology. Enterprise Isomorphic Architecture (EIA) was built as an effective architectural solution to coordinate powerful technologies with business applications to enable seamless inter- organizational integration. As the core part of EIA, Enterprise Isomorphic Layer Structure (EILS) studied in this paper is to provide structural and semantic identification of integrating EIS entities based on the ontology hierarchy for interoperability in problem domain. EILS allows reaching desired interoperability level of existing EIS by realizing business agility and IT infrastructure, consolidating processes between them, and facilitating business changes with simultaneous evolution of the IT infrastructure. Application of interoperable EIS based on EILS will give valuable positive practical effect in EIS integration.","2161-9654","978-1-4244-2107-7","10.1109/WiCom.2008.2798","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4680987","","Ontologies;XML;Resource description framework;Information systems;Concrete;Companies;Gallium nitride;Power generation economics;Technology management;Management information systems","","3","","13","IEEE","18 Nov 2008","12-14 Oct. 2008","12-14 Oct. 2008","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We extend that trend by presenting a model for semantic interoperability with XML. The model is comprised of two parts: semantic representation and semantic mapping. In the semantic representation model we start by analyzing the different types of semantic information that are usually impeded in the data and not explicitly represented. Then we introduce a model to represent this information as XML document called the semantic definition. In the semantic mapping process we define a component called the semantic mapping agent SMA that has an interface that allows it to store different semantic definition and then to map values from one semantic definition to the other.","","0-9744559-0-3","10.1109/SIEDS.2003.158012","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1242407","","XML;Automation;Books","","3","","4","","2 May 2005","24-25 April 2003","24-25 April 2003","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Besides standardized inter-device communication, this task needs an engine for semantic mediation between heterogeneous communication partners. This work analyses the requirements that need to be satisfied by such an engine. It will have to transform messages between different forms of standardized representation in the operational environment of an open communication framework. Especially the information exchange between devices and information systems will be dependent on the engine's reliable and verifiable semantic mediation. Being deployed on an embedded device in a service-oriented architecture based on web services, the component will have to comply not only with international healthcare standards and medical device directives but also with W3C specifications to provide and describe its capabilities.

The challenge is the HIS are heterogeneous systems with unstructured data, different data formats, developed by different vendors and are running on different software. One source of disease surveillance data is provided by communities in a phenomenon normally referred to as crowdsourcing. As a result, the objective of this study was to develop a prototype that allows crowdsource users to utilise their mobile devices to access, exchange and communicate disease surveillance data in real time directly to the District Health Information Systems (DHIS-2) in regional offices and the national office of the Ministry of Health and Social Services (MoHSS) in Namibia for semantic interoperability. The current method used for communicating disease surveillance information between the MoHSS, and its agency, the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) and public health institutions is a manual system which is not appropriate as it causes delays in the exchange of information among them.

However, e-government systems along with heterogeneous databases have created difficulties in interoperability. These heterogeneous databases lead to data redundancy, data inconsistency, and difficulty to integrate data and process data among agencies. The representation of heterogeneous systems through common standards and vocabularies is considered a valuable solution for interoperability. In this paper, an ontology-based framework for Bhutan's e-government is proposed to support semantic interoperability. To evaluate the framework, the domain ontology for Bhutan's Administrative Division, namely BTNAD is developed and discussed. BTNAD Ontology has been implemented and verified using Protégé, and its practical usage has been validated by checking against the defined competency questions and the corresponding SP ARQL query implementation. The presented study can clearly demonstrate the Single Source of Truth (SSOT), hence enabling the data reusability and collaboration, and interoperability within and across the agencies.

An attribute ontology of software component is introduced to provide rich semantic information. We also explain how to implement a software component registry based on classification by applying the attribute ontology.","","0-7695-2315-3","10.1109/ITCC.2005.216","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1425142","","Ontologies;Application software;Software standards;Helium;Web services;Laboratories;Software engineering;Government;Computer industry;Web and internet services","","3","","15","IEEE","31 May 2005","4-6 April 2005","4-6 April 2005","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, due to the variety of IoT identifier frameworks used by different objects, IoT identifiers are heterogeneous from each other. Therefore, it is difficult for objects with heterogeneous identifiers to cooperate with each other without the human intervention. To address this issue, we propose a semantic-based identifier framework named Semantic Code (S-Code) to mediate between heterogeneous IoT identifiers. S-Code provides a semantic prefix for each legacy identifier and maps the identified objects to the IoT ontology. By S-Code, heterogeneous identifiers can be resolved in a uniform way, and objects can work together autonomously. To verify the effectiveness of S-Code, a self-service store use-case is presented, and the results confirm the capability of S-Code in supporting interoperability of heterogeneous identifiers of IoT.","","978-1-7281-3488-8","10.1109/SmartIoT.2019.00056","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8896489","Semantic Code, IoT, heterogeneous identifiers, interoperability","Codes;Semantics;Ontologies;Object recognition;Internet of Things;Interoperability;Self-service","","3","","13","IEEE","14 Nov 2019","9-11 Aug. 2019","9-11 Aug. 2019","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Sources of this problem include the lack of support for semantic evolution management in ontology-based service oriented systems, and the static nature of the mappings between ontologies in this environment. To address these issues, we have developed P2OManager, an interactive tool for ontology evolution management. This system allows the users to automatically create an ontology agent manager. This agent manages evolution on both ontology and mappings and communicates with other ontology agents to take them aware of all changes which may affect exchanges with their services. Examples illustrate how P2OManager can provide valuable support for ontology evolution management, when specific changes are provided.","1524-4547","978-1-4577-0134-4","10.1109/WETICE.2011.15","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5990020","semantic web service;ontology evolution;multi-agent system","Ontologies;Semantics;Service oriented architecture;Receivers;Proposals;Syntactics;OWL","","2","","12","IEEE","18 Aug 2011","27-29 June 2011","27-29 June 2011","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, it is essential to have interoperability standards that enable such communication, but although several standards are available for this purpose, in order to make better use of such information, such as making inferences or integrated queries that depend on the semantics of a specific context, such as the public policies of a country, it is necessary to use modeling techniques according to the context. In this sense, this paper presents a solution for semantic interoperability between Health Information Systems, through the use of ontologies. For this purpose, we start from the definition of a Minimum Data Set for Primary Health Care in Paraguay, this Minimum Data Set is used as the basis for the development of an ontology, which for the scope of this work, and as a demonstration, the vaccination area was taken as a scenario. For the ontology validation process, the necessary syntactic interoperability was also implemented to integrate some testing systems and enable the execution of ontological queries.","2771-5752","978-1-6654-7671-3","10.1109/CLEI56649.2022.9959960","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9959960","minimum data set;interoperability;semantic interoperability;syntactic interoperability;ontologies;public health;health information system","Semantics;Ontologies;Syntactics;Vaccines;Public policy;Public healthcare;Interoperability","","1","","0","IEEE","28 Nov 2022","17-21 Oct. 2022","17-21 Oct. 2022","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Starting from a previously developed prototype of HRT ontology, based on the conceptual model of SNOMED-CT in the electronic health records (EHR), an HRT archetype has been created, yielding an agreed, formal, and interoperable specification for representing clinical entities within the EHR. The built archetype binder with the HRT ontology achieves: (1) a standardized HRT data structure, involving domain specialists; (2) interoperability in HRT data exchange; (3) structured HRT recordings for a simple follow up by medical societies, and with statistical, research and educational purposes. We also propose a simple system to bind the HRT ontology with the archetype, hence enabling clinicians the continuos improvement and clinical research in this domain.","2325-8853","978-1-4799-4347-0","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7043088","","Ontologies;Terminology;Standards;Semantics;Interoperability;Heart rate;Electrocardiography","","1","","15","","19 Feb 2015","7-10 Sept. 2014","7-10 Sept. 2014","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The techniques include Hopfield network and associate constraint network with backmarking. Although these techniques obtain satisfactory performance, they have weaknesses in efficiency, consistency, precision or recall. In this work, we develop a new searching technique, namely forward evaluation, on the basis of our previously developed associate constraint network model.

Despite significant progress in development of data management and exchange solutions (e.g., the FAIR principles for open data), information is often poorly managed, badly structured, and lacks context, complicating data integration. There's a need for improved or new modes of storage, sharing, recovery, modification of data. This doctoral project proposal outlines a possible solution by way of data interoperability across different information systems and technological platforms. This doesn't imply compatibility of different information systems on a hardware-software level, but intersystem data representation and interpretation with the help of common standards and protocols. Such an approach has to be based on distributed data architectures designed with semantic models that facilitate information exchange. Semantic interoperability requires (and therefore assures) that data that is being exchanged is interpreted consistently by all parties. This doctoral research aims to develop new methods of ensuring semantic interoperability through standardization, formalization, and ontologies as primary data interchangeability enablers. The main objectives are: to identify methods of designing new distributed data architectures that ensure semantic interoperability; to develop a methodology for implementing protocols that guarantee semantic interoperability in distributed systems; to create new models of interaction of heterogeneous network entities, and a protocol that supports effortless data interchangeability; to develop new methods of validation and verification of the developed protocol. The expected results consist of new formal and empirical methods of ensuring semantic interoperability in distributed information and communication systems. These methods would contain: a language for modeling interoperable data, and a protocol for semantic interoperability in distributed systems.","2247-5443","979-8-3315-5713-3","10.1109/RoEduNet68395.2025.11208279","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11208279","data serialization;ontologies;FAIR principles;knowledge graphs;Semantic Web","Protocols;Semantics;Distributed databases;Medical services;Ontologies;Solids;Data models;Interoperability;Standards;Information systems","","","","21","IEEE","30 Oct 2025","17-20 Sept. 2025","17-20 Sept. 2025","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Coherent local interpretation of shared representations is needed to create global semantic coherence for the distributed systems. Ontology technology is a useful approach to information integration. But when the categories of the relative concepts of ontologies are different, the semantic interoperation will encounter new obstacles. Except that the schema carries information, the data also carry abundant information, which assists to further interoperate.

Much like technical interoperability in software and systems, the clarification of terminology facilitates semantic interoperability, which serves as a foundation for cooperation among diverse stakeholders. At the ISMAR 2024 panel session titled ""xR is dead, long live XR!"" participants addressed the definitional ambiguity surrounding XR and the resulting challenges in mutual understanding, evaluation, and communication within the research community. The panelists explored a range of topics, including the re-examination of conceptual boundaries between VR, AR, and MR, and discrepancies in terminology across academia, industry, and standardization bodies. During the open discussion, the merits and limitations of using ""XR"" as an umbrella term were debated, along with the need to ensure inclusiveness, neutrality, and transparency in language. Other practical challenges were also highlighted, such as the importance of context-sensitive terminology and the appropriate timing for standardization. The session underscored the urgency of addressing fragmentation and fostering cross-sectoral cooperation through standardization. In response to these discussions, a new Standardization Committee was formally launched at ISMAR 2025. This paper also introduces the committee's mission and objectives.","2771-1110","979-8-3315-9347-6","10.1109/ISMAR-Adjunct68609.2025.00102","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11236336","XR;Metaverse;Terminology;Taxonomy;Reality–Virtuality Continuum;Semantic Interoperability;Standardization","Industries;Terminology;Metaverse;Semantics;Taxonomy;Software;Timing;Stakeholders;Interoperability;Standards","","","","17","IEEE","18 Nov 2025","8-12 Oct. 2025","8-12 Oct. 2025","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The coming together of such organizations, usually enhanced by computer network, is referred to as virtual enterprise (VE) or task group. This partnership is only possible if the systems in the various associated organizations can process the data in one another. A major challenge in the enterprise collaborative system that has attracted many research efforts in the recent past is semantic interoperability. This collaborative-based market place requires among others common conceptualization and meaningful data exchange. Effective collaboration among VE members is a major key to the accomplishment of this noble objective. For this interoperability to be effective, we propose in this paper an ontology-based middleware framework ldquoOntology Gatewayrdquo used by players in such situation to exchange information needed to carry out the process.

As the world is not static and all things tend to evolve also enterprises evolve. Unfortunately, interoperable applications make the complex task of information system evolution even more complex. This has the consequence that changes are very expensive or that they are simply not realized. This results in static structures which are not fully suited to deal with the Enterprises needs. Changes happen on the syntactic and the semantic level. A change on the syntactic level can be a simple rename of a field in an exchanged document. A change on the semantic level is typically the case if the domain changes. This means that the meaning of data is changed. There are conflicting constraints for solutions supporting semantic interoperability in evolutionary enterprises: The necessity of expressive languages for formulating the changes and the consequences including the formulation of transformations on the one hand and the requirement for a very high throughput and the computation of a large number of instance documents on the other hand. We therefore introduce an architecture which is intended to combine scalability with complex reasoning. Ontological languages and tools, transformation of XML documents and the techniques for knowledge compilation are the basis for finding a viable and affordable solution.","","978-0-85358-259-5","10.1109/ITMC.2009.7461391","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7461391","Information System Evolution;Ontology Evolution;XML Schema Evolution;Instance Migration","XML;Generators","","","","20","IEEE","28 Apr 2016","22-24 June 2009","22-24 June 2009","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

I will start by presenting our experience and lessons learnt in building ""assistive environments"" for the elderly, to demonstrate the need for space programmability and to define critical new requirements particular to smart spaces. I will then present ATLAS, a middleware architecture and a sensor platform that supports self-integration and enables SODA -- a Service-Oriented Device Architecture standard. I will show how ATLAS was used as the foundation on which we built and programmed the Gator Tech Smart House, and how it enabled pervasive application development, and scalable data collection and analysis. I will then delineate the limitations of SODA and present programming model extensions that address space and user safety as well as reliability and scalability. Finally, I will present our views of a possible ecosystem within which our programming models and system support can be used to promote the interoperation and the proliferation of programmable and manageable smart spaces.","","978-0-7695-4423-6","10.1109/SAINT.2011.53","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6004170","pervasive computing;programming models;interoperability;middleware;pervasive spaces","Programming;Biological system modeling;Computational modeling;Pervasive computing;Middleware;Scalability;Smart homes","","","","","IEEE","25 Aug 2011","18-21 July 2011","18-21 July 2011","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To fully realize this potential, there is a need for a common way to abstract the heterogeneity of devices so that their functionality can be represented as a virtual computing platform. To this end, we present novel semantic level interoperability architecture for pervasive computing and IoTs. There are two main principles in the proposed architecture. First, information and capabilities of devices are represented with semantic web knowledge representation technologies and interaction with devices and the physical world is achieved by accessing and modifying their virtual representations. Second, global IoT is divided into numerous local smart spaces managed by a semantic information broker (SIB) that provides a means to monitor and update the virtual representation of the physical world. An integral part of the architecture is a resolution infrastructure that provides a means to resolve the network address of a SIB either using a physical object identifier as a pointer to information or by searching SIBs matching a specification represented with SPARQL. We present several reference implementations and applications that we have developed to evaluate the architecture in practice. The evaluation also includes performance studies that, together with the applications, demonstrate the suitability of the architecture to real-life IoT scenarios. In addition, to validate that the proposed architecture conforms to the common IoT-A architecture reference model (ARM), we map the central components of the architecture to the IoT-ARM.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2014.2347992","SOFIA and IoE ARTEMIS Projects; IMPRESS/EU Project; Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation; VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, Oulu, Finland; Italian Ministry of Education and Research; University of Bologna, Bologna, Finland; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6879461","Internet of Things;pervasive computing;RDF;semantic interoperability;system architecture;SPARQL","Semantics;Computer architecture;Interoperability;Pervasive computing;Context awareness;Sensors;Resource description framework","","133","","55","OAPA","18 Aug 2014","2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Enhancing the semantic interoperability of multimedia through a core ontology","J. Hunter","DSTC Private Limited, University of Queensland, Saint Lucia, QLD, Australia",IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology,"28 Feb 2003","2003","13","1","49","58","A core ontology is one of the key building blocks necessary to enable the scalable assimilation of information from diverse multimedia sources. A complete and extensible ontology that expresses the basic concepts that are common across a variety of domains and media types and that can provide the basis for specialization into domain-specific concepts and vocabularies, is essential for well-defined mappings between domain-specific knowledge representations (i.e., metadata vocabularies) and the subsequent building of a variety of services such as cross-domain searching, tracking, browsing, data mining and knowledge acquisition. As more and more communities develop metadata application profiles which combine terms from multiple vocabularies (e.g., Dublin Core, MPEG-7, MPEG-21, CIDOC/CRM, FGDC, IMS), a core ontology will provide a common understanding of the basic entities and relationships, which is essential for semantic interoperability and the development of additional services based on deductive inferencing. In this paper, we first propose such a core ontology (the ABC model) which was developed in response to a need to integrate information from multiple genres of multimedia content within digital libraries and archives. Although the MPEG-21 RDD was influenced by the ABC model and is based on a model extremely similar to ABC, we believe that it is important to define a separate and domain-independent top-level extensible ontology for scenarios in which either MPEG-21 is irrelevant or to enable the attachment of ontologies from communities external to MPEG, for example, the museum domain (CIDOC/CRM) or the biomedical domain (ON9.3). We evaluate the ABC model's ability to mediate and integrate between multimedia metadata vocabularies by illustrating how it can provide the foundation to facilitate semantic interoperability between MPEG-7, MPEG-21 and other domain-specific metadata vocabularies. By expressing the semantics of both MPEG-7 and MPEG-21 metadata terms in RDF Schema/DAML+OIL [and eventually the Web Ontology Language (OWL)] and attaching the MPEG-7 and MPEG-21 class and property hierarchies to the appropriate top-level classes and properties of the ABC model, we have defined a single distributed machine-understandable ontology. The resulting ontology provides semantic knowledge which is nonexistent within declarative XML schemas or XML-encoded metadata descriptions. Finally, in order to illustrate how such an ontology will contribute to the interoperability of data and services across the entire multimedia content delivery chain, we describe a number of valuable services which have been developed or could potentially be developed using the resulting merged ontologies.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2002.808088","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1180381","","Ontologies;Vocabulary;MPEG 7 Standard;OWL;Knowledge representation;Data mining;Knowledge acquisition;Software libraries;Resource description framework;Microstrip","","82","4","38","IEEE","28 Feb 2003","Jan. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

On the other hand, Blockchain technologies are emerging as promising and cost-effective means to meet some of these requirements due to their inherent design properties, such as secure cryptography and a resilient peer-to-peer network. Likewise, Blockchain-based applications can benefit the healthcare domain via their properties of asset sharing, and audit trails of data access. Existing work mainly pays attention to centralized and blockchain-based mechanisms. But it doesn’t realize the increase need for better data interoperability amount multiple healthcare systems and services. This requires shifting from the application-centric solutions toward the patient-centric solutions. This paper presents A secure and efficient framework based on Blockchain, Cloud, and IoT named Patient-Centric Healthcare Framework (PCH) for better healthcare systems interoperability. A tiered-based architecture (5 tiers) with collaboration is designed for the feasible realization of PCH. Also, the design and implementation aspects start from the layering diagram, system context, and detailed reference architecture that emphasizes the detailed component topology and interactions within the framework. An electronic medical record is used to show how healthcare data is processed with the required security considerations. Then, an evaluation of PCH against the existing Blockchain-based healthcare frameworks is conducted. The results analysis demonstrates that PCH offers practical solutions to protect healthcare data and support efficient data sharing with better interoperability.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3202902","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9869824","Blockchain;chaincode;digital health;distributed ledger technology (DLT);eHealth;EHRs sharing;electronic health records (EHRs);endorsement;fabric;health information exchange;Hyperledger;ordering service;smart contracts","Blockchains;Medical services;Distributed ledger;Interoperability;Computer architecture;Security;Data privacy","","75","","45","CCBY","29 Aug 2022","2022","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The foundational idea of our research is that the communication based on semantics and the generation of meaningful textual data are directly linked, and we posit that these processes are equivalent if the exchanged information can be serialized in text form. Based on this, we construct a “semantic node” data structure in our research to capture the semantic essence of textual data. Then, a system powered by large language models is designed and implemented to process the “semantic node” and generate standardized digital twin models (AAS instance models in the context of Industry 4.0) from raw textual data collected from datasheets describing technical assets. Our evaluation demonstrates an effective generation rate of 62-79%, indicating a substantial proportion of the information from the source text can be translated error-free to the target digital twin instance model with the generative capability of large language models. This result has a direct application in the context of Industry 4.0, and the designed system is implemented as a data model generation tool for reducing the manual effort in creating AAS model by automatically translating unstructured textual data into a standardized AAS model. The generated AAS model can be integrated into AAS-compliant digital twin software for seamless information exchange and communication. In our evaluation, a comparative analysis of different LLMs and an in-depth ablation study of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanisms provide insights into the effectiveness of LLM systems for interpreting technical concepts and translating data. Our findings emphasize LLMs’ capability to automate AAS instance creation and contribute to the broader field of semantic interoperability for digital twins in industrial applications.

This is an outstanding challenge in the development of Industry 4.0 due to the trend towards dynamic re-configurable production processes with increasingly complex automation systems and a diversity of standards, components, tools and services. The cost of making systems interoperable is a major limiting factor in the adoption of new technology and the envisioned development of production industry. Therefore, methods and concepts enabling efficient interoperation of heterogeneous systems are investigated to understand how the interoperability problem should be addressed. To support this development, we survey the literature on interoperability to identify automation approaches that address semantic interoperability, in particular in dynamic cyber-physical systems at large scale. We find that different aspects of the interoperability problem are investigated, some based on a conventional bottom-up standardization approach, while others consider a goal-driven computational approach; and that the different directions explored are related to open questions that motivates further research. We argue that a goaldriven machine learning approach to semantic interoperability can result in solutions that are applicable across standardization domains and thus is a promising direction of research in this era of the industrial internet of things.","2378-363X","978-1-5386-4829-2","10.1109/INDIN.2018.8471971","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8471971","","Interoperability;Semantics;Ontologies;Industries;Standards;Automation;Tools","","52","","35","IEEE","27 Sep 2018","18-20 July 2018","18-20 July 2018","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In summary, the main contributions of our ontology-based proposal are the following: first, it includes a canonical ontology whose EHR-related terms focus on semantic aspects. As a result, their descriptions are independent of languages and technology aspects used in different organizations to represent EHRs. Moreover, those terms are related to their corresponding codes in well-known medical terminologies. Second, it deals with modules that allow obtaining rich ontological representations of EHR information managed by proprietary models of health information systems. The features of one specific module are shown as reference. Third, it considers the necessary mapping axioms between ontological terms enhanced with so-called path mappings.

The proposed system, in fact, will help users in the digital documents exchanging activities by extracting the related relevant information and coding their informative contents in a shape capable of preserving the original semantics, also in the case of communications agents using different or incompatible vocabularies. The framework is a an evolution of semantic interoperable methodologies towards cloud computer technologies, thus guaranteeing several advantages in terms of usability, scalability and fault tolerance.

To increase this efficiency, the parties involved in a regulated clinical research study, namely, the sponsor, the clinical investigator and the regulatory body, each with their own software applications, need to exchange data seamlessly. However, currently, the clinical research and the clinical care domains are quite disconnected because each use different standards and terminology systems. In this paper, we describe an initial implementation of the Semantic Framework developed within the scope of SALUS project to achieve interoperability between the clinical research and the clinical care domains. In our Semantic Framework, the core ontology developed for semantic mediation is based on the shared conceptual model of both of these domains provided by the Biomedical Research Integrated Domain Group (BRIDG) initiative. The core ontology is then aligned with the extracted semantic models of the existing clinical care and research standards as well as with the ontological representations of the terminology systems to create a “model of meaning” for enabling semantic mediation. Although SALUS is a research and development effort rather than a product, the current SALUS knowledge base contains around 4.7 million triples representing BRIDG DAM, HL7 CDA model, Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium standards, and several terminology ontologies. In order to keep the reasoning process within acceptable limits without sacrificing the quality of mediation, we took an engineering approach by developing a number of heuristic mechanisms. The results indicate that it is possible to build a robust and scalable semantic framework with a solid theoretical foundation for achieving interoperability between the clinical research and clinical care domains.","2168-2208","","10.1109/TITB.2012.2219552","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6305484","Biomedical Research Integrated Domain Group (BRIDG);clinical research;electronic data capture (EDC) systems;electronic health record (EHR) systems;interoperability;semantic mediation","Semantics;Standards;Ontologies;Unified modeling language;Terminology;Drugs","Biomedical Research;Computer Communication Networks;Database Management Systems;Electronic Health Records;Humans;Medical Informatics Applications;Semantics","30","","54","IEEE","7 Mar 2013","March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Consequently, sharing patient's EHRs is becoming a global priority in the healthcare information technology domain. This paper addresses the interoperability of EHR structure and content. It describes how two different EHR standards derived from the same reference information model (RIM) can be mapped to each other by using archetypes, refined message information model (R-MIM) derivations, and semantic tools. It is also demonstrated that well-defined R-MIM derivation rules help tracing the class properties back to their origins when the R-MIMs of two EHR standards are derived from the same RIM. Using well-defined rules also enable finding equivalences in the properties of the source and target EHRs. Yet an R-MIM still defines the concepts at the generic level. Archetypes (or templates), on the other hand, constrain an R-MIM to domain-specific concepts, and hence, provide finer granularity semantics. Therefore, while mapping clinical statements between EHRs, we also make use of the archetype semantics. Derivation statements are inferred from the Web Ontology Language definitions of the RIM, the R-MIMs, and the archetypes. Finally, we show how to transform Health Level Seven clinical statement instances to EHRcom clinical statement instances and vice versa by using the generated mapping definitions.","1558-0032","","10.1109/TITB.2008.904647","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5156191","Archetypes;clinical document sharing;eHealth;EHRcom;Health Level Seven (HL7) clinical document architecture (CDA);integrating healthcare enterprise (IHE) profiles;semantic interoperability","Medical services;Costs;Information technology;Medical treatment;Standards development;Standardization;Back;OWL;Consumer electronics;Laboratories","Algorithms;Medical Record Linkage;Medical Records Systems, Computerized;Models, Theoretical;Semantics;Systems Integration;Vocabulary, Controlled","27","","45","IEEE","6 Jul 2009","July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Aiming at this problem, this article presents a dataspaces model utilizing distributed approaches to represent semantic information as a sustainable solution for IoT semantic interoperability. In this model, an attention-based entity embedding approach is designed to convert IoT entities into low-dimensional dense vectors, then calculations, including entities, relations, etc., can be further conducted. Consequently, the entity embeddings could reflect the semantic information of Class equivalences among entities. To recognize entity relations, the generated entity vectors and the arithmetic results of two entities are combined as input features. By feeding the input features to a well-trained Tensor-train modified DNN, the relation between two entities could be recognized. Finally, experiments are conducted on two data sets to evaluate the proposed approaches. Results indicate that the generated entity vectors could effectively reflect the semantic similarity between entities. More importantly, while achieving parameter compression and better generalizing ability, the relation recognition approach improves the relation recognition accuracy on new entities compared with the state-of-art models.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3097068","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61772352); National Key Research and Development Project(grant numbers:2020YFB1711800,2020YFB1707900); Sichuan Province Science and Technology Support Program(grant numbers:2019YFG0400,2020YFG0479,2020YFG0322); Research and Development Project of Chengdu City(grant numbers:2019-YF05-01790-GX); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9484096","Distributed representation;entity embedding;Internet of Things (IoT);semantic data and service;semantic interoperability","Semantics;Internet of Things;Interoperability;Data models;Distributed databases;Training;Resource description framework","","19","","36","IEEE","14 Jul 2021","15 May15, 2022","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Initial results show that current integration approaches mainly focus on performance evaluation of their integration solutions, which may be too narrow for fulfilling user goals by utilizing of IoT architectures.","1558-0040","","10.1109/TEM.2019.2922103","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8767043","AI systems engineering;knowledge-based methods and approaches;semantic interoperability;software architecture;systematic literature review","Software architecture;Semantics;Interoperability;Knowledge based systems","","18","","47","IEEE","19 Jul 2019","Dec. 2022","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Properties with a predefined and standardized meaning are one pillar of such an information exchange. Another pillar is the exchange of information about relationships between semantic entities by an appropriate system description metamodel. In this paper, we focus on the information exchange of property value expressions. Within the last years, domain-specific lists of properties have been standardized. The development was driven by the need to exchange information of industrial products electronically. The standardized lists allow an unambiguous characterization of products. Results of this comprehensive work done by the standardization committees within the last years are, for example, the international standard series IEC 61360CDD, IEC 61987, and the property library eCl@ss. In these standards, thousands of properties of technical assets are semantically defined. An intuitive and general concept to use these standardized properties for information exchange is crucial for the future system design. One recent approach is the so-called property value statement model. In this paper, the basic concepts of this approach are presented. Additionally, methods to reason about property information in a general way are discussed. The presented concepts fit to the standardized property definition models and build a platform for a metadata-based information handling in the digital factory.","1941-0050","","10.1109/TII.2017.2741339","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8012453","Cooperative systems;infomation exchange;interoperability;manufacturing automation;property;reasoning;semantics","Semantics;Adaptation models;Information exchange;Informatics;Interoperability","","18","","24","IEEE","17 Aug 2017","Dec. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However interoperability within different healthcare systems (clinics/hospitals/pharmacies) remains an issue of further research due to a lack of collaboration and exchange of healthcare information. To solve this problem, cross healthcare system collaboration is required. This paper proposes a conceptual semantic based healthcare collaboration framework based on Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure that is able to offer a secure cross system information and knowledge exchange between different healthcare systems seamlessly that is readable by both machines and humans. In the proposed framework, an intelligent semantic gateway is introduced where a web application with restful Application Programming Interface (API) is used to expose the healthcare information of each system for collaboration. A case study that exposed the patient's data between two different healthcare systems was practically demonstrated where a pharmacist can access the patient's electronic prescription from the clinic.","","978-1-5386-7503-8","10.1109/FiCloud.2018.00060","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8458037","Internet of Things;Healthcare Interoperability;Smart Gateway;Semantic Web;Ontology;Sensor Networks","Medical services;Interoperability;Semantics;Logic gates;Standards;Collaboration;Cloud computing","","14","","13","IEEE","11 Sep 2018","6-8 Aug. 2018","6-8 Aug. 2018","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Digital Twins are one of the key enabling technologies for Industry 4.0. However, the interoperability gap among digital representation of Industry 4.0 assets is still one of the obstacles to the development and adoption of digital twins. If the Asset Administration Shell (AAS), the standard proposed to represent the I4.0 components, caters for syntactic interoperability, a more semantic kind of interoperability is deeply needed to develop flexible and adaptable production lines. In our work, we overcome the limitation of current syntactic-only resource matching algorithms by implementing semantic interoperability based on ontologies i.e., by transforming AAS-based plant models into MaRCO (Manufacturing Resource Capability Ontology) instances and then query the expanded ontology to find the needed resources. This article presents this ontology-based approach as the first step towards the design and implementation of an automated I4.0 flexible plant supervision and control system based on model-driven engineering (MDE) within the “Papyrus for Manufacturing” toolset. We show how an MDE approach can aggregate around digital twin modeling tools from the Papyrus platform both I4.0 technologies and AI (Knowledge Representation and Reasoning) tools. Our platform aligns modeling and ontological elements to get the best of both worlds. This method has two main advantages: (1) to provide semantic descriptions for digital twin models, (2) to complement model-driven engineering tools with automated reasoning. This paper showcases this approach through a robotic cell use case.","2769-3899","979-8-3503-1125-9","10.1109/ICPS58381.2023.10128003","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10128003","Digital Twins;Industry 4.0;Asset Administration Shell;Semantic Interoperability;Ontology;Model-Based Engineering","Adaptation models;Unified modeling language;Semantics;Production;Ontologies;Cognition;Digital twins","","12","","24","IEEE","24 May 2023","8-11 May 2023","8-11 May 2023","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Specially due to the carbon-intense generation plants that are deployed to address these peak demands. Demand side management activities such as peak demand curtailment or load reallocation, have a huge potential to match energy demand with energy supply side as well as for a better management of their disparity. This is particularly true for residential buildings which are still a largely untapped sector. Since renewable energy sources (e.g. solar and wind power) are increasingly penetrating the energy production side, their dependence on the weather and climatic conditions largely influences their management and exploitation. In order to tackle these issues, Demand Response (DR) programs are introduced into the smart grids so that reliable and economical operation of power systems are ensured. The RESPOND project aims to deploy an interoperable energy automation, monitoring and control solution that will deliver demand response at a dwelling, building and district level getting advantage of the user engagement to achieve a cooperative demand response behavior. In this paper, focus is placed on the data integration and semantic interoperability issues identified in this project.

For example, information from multiple protein databases (e.g., Swiss-Prot and PDB) might need to be composed to answer queries posed by end-users. Problems of heterogeneity in hardware, operating systems, interfaces and data structures have been widely addressed, but issues of diverse semantics have been handled mainly in an ad-hoc fashion. This paper highlights the ONION (ONtology compositION) system that enables semantic interoperation among various information sources by articulating the ontologies associated with them. An articulation focuses on the semantically relevant intersection of information resources. Although the generation of articulations (semantic correspondences between the ontologies) cannot be fully automated, we take a semi-automatic approach. ONION uses heuristic algorithms for the automatic generation of suggested articulations. This paper outlines an algebra for ontology composition based on their articulations. We show the properties of the algebraic operators and how they depend upon the articulation functions that generate the articulations. Query optimization is enabled based on the properties of the algebraic operators.","","0-7695-1423-5","10.1109/BIBE.2001.974427","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=974427","","Algebra;Ontologies;Information systems;Proteins;Databases;Hardware;Operating systems;Data structures;Information resources;Heuristic algorithms","","12","","16","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","4-6 Nov. 2001","4-6 Nov. 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Achieving interoperability for distributed EHR systems is expected to improve patient safety and care continuity, and therefore it improves the healthcare industry. However, achieving interoperability is challenging because of many standards, medical terminologies and ontologies, and different data formats. These formats make the integration of different systems an impossible process. If the hospital uses one standard to implement all of its medical systems, it will be no problem integrating them. However, hospitals usually depend on multiple standards and data formats to deliver different systems like hospital information systems, radiology information systems, laboratory information systems, etc. Semantic Web presents new technology for achieving EHRs interoperability. In this paper, we propose a novel ontological model to implement interoperability for distributed EHR environments. The proposed semantic ontology-based model can unify different EHRs data formats. In this study, We unify five different and popular healthcare data formats and standards. In addition, the framework could be extended straightforwardly to accept any other EHR data format. By implementing the proposed in real environments, we provide the physician with a single interface with a single terminology to query and interact with distributed healthcare systems that use different standards and data formats. This process is expected to help the physician to collect patient data from different systems quickly, completely, and correctly. The proposed ontological model has two stages. The first stage of the proposed converts each different input source to OWL ontology. In the second stage, it integrates all those ontologies into a merged crisp one. The integrated ontology includes 3753 axioms, 2606 logical axioms, 186 classes, 136 individuals, 126 datatype properties, and 257 object properties. We use SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language (SPARQL) and Description Logic (DL) queries to evaluate the output ontology. The obtained results ensure that the proposed framework helps physicians and specialists make a centralized point for all patients’ data. It could aggregate data with any heterogeneous structures with high precision.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3223676","National Research Foundation of Korea through the Korean Government (Ministry of Science and ICT)(grant numbers:NRF-2020R1A2B5B02002478); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9956805","Interoperability;electronic health record (EHR);ontology;openEHR archetype","Ontologies;Interoperability;Medical services;Semantics;Interoperability;Biomedical imaging;XML","","12","","91","CCBY","21 Nov 2022","2022","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This enables knowledge discovery, machine computable reasoning and federation of different information systems. Traditionally, technologies from the Semantic Web are adapted in order to capture the inherited properties of the Internet of Things (IoT) domain. Such technologies provide common description and representation of data and services; they characterize things and their capabilities, deal with the semantic annotation, resource discovery, access management, knowledge extraction in a machine-readable or interoperable manner. Thus, the common interpretation of semantic information in a globally shared ontology could be quite useful. However, several local systems may utilize popular or standardized ontologies, eventually they extend them and establish their own semantics and interfaces. As a result, the direct interaction between these systems is not feasible. With this in mind, our goal is to propose the use of semantic interoperability mechanisms, which correlates the required information and enables the interoperability of systems with different semantics or cross-domain interaction.

This has recently gained a great attention because of cloud pay-as-you-go model which drastically reduces actual IT infrastructure with high performance and continuous availability. In order to effectively utilize existing cloud resources, organizations may look for available cloud resources from different cloud providers. However, cloud resources are heterogeneous and described by different standards which prevents an easy and dynamic interoperability between organizations. In this paper, we propose a semantic framework tackling this heterogeneity issue. We develop a set of ontologies to semantically represent cloud resources by looking at three cloud resource description standards: Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications (TOSCA), Open Cloud Computing Interface (OCCI), and Cloud Infrastructure Management Interface (CIMI). Hence, our framework promotes the creation of a common semantic knowledge base of cloud resources described using these different standards. This knowledge base allows a seamless translation of cloud providers' resource descriptions. We developed an application to validate our approach as a proof of concept. We also evaluated the feasibility and completeness of our semantic framework on use cases obtained from standard specifications.","2159-6190","978-1-5090-2619-7","10.1109/CLOUD.2016.0083","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7820320","Cloud computing;cloud resource description standard;semantic web technologies;ontology","Cloud computing;Ontologies;Semantics;Interoperability;Standards organizations;Organizations","","11","","43","IEEE","19 Jan 2017","27 June-2 July 2016","27 June-2 July 2016","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose to take advantage of the Open Cloud Computing Interface (OCCI) standard and the Alloy formal specification language to define the fclouds language, which is a formal language for specifying heterogeneous cloud APIs. To do so, we formalize OCCI concepts and operational semantics, then we identify and validate five properties (consistency, sequentiality, reversibility, idempotence and safety) that denote their characteristics. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our cloud formal language, we present thirteen case studies where we formally specify infrastructure, platform, Internet of Things (IoT) and transverse cloud concerns. Thanks to the Alloy analyzer, we verify that these heterogeneous APIs uphold the properties of fclouds and also validate their own specific properties. Then, thanks to formal transformation rules and equivalence properties, we draw a precise alignment between our case studies, which promotes semantic interoperability in a multi-cloud system.","2159-6190","978-1-5386-7235-8","10.1109/CLOUD.2018.00053","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8457821","Multi-Clouds;OCCI;Formal Language;Formal Verification;Alloy;Interoperability","Cloud computing;Semantics;Interoperability;Formal languages;Metals;Standards;Virtual machining","","10","","31","IEEE","11 Sep 2018","2-7 July 2018","2-7 July 2018","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Because of the creation and expansion of new and existing sensor networks, the need to define a common standard for sensors' interfaces representation has arisen. Currently it is difficult to make different sensors and sensors' networks interoperate seamlessly, since their interfaces are not always well specified or are not ready to be adapted immediately to one another. In order to overcome the current lack of a shared standard, in this paper we propose an IoT framework which, by analysing sensors' APIs RESTful descriptions and the interfaces exposed by smart-sensors, tries to integrate different sensors' interfaces into a common Aggregator. Such an Aggregator relies on wrappers and adapters, either automatically built or provided by experts, to make programming and using sensors from different providers completely opaque to the users, who only sees a set of general and abstract functions available. Semantic technologies and matching algorithms are used to support the creation of such wrappers and to easily discover and categorize new sensor types.","","978-1-5090-4429-0","10.1109/ICNSC.2017.8000071","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8000071","","Sensors;Standards;Social network services;Machine-to-machine communications;Interoperability;Software;Internet of Things","","9","","22","IEEE","3 Aug 2017","16-18 May 2017","16-18 May 2017","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

So there is an interoperability issue between these different type of private clouds, to solve this issue it is essential to describe a common mechanism. In this paper, we have devised a a broker based architectural framework to solve the interoperability issue between the Eucalyptus and OpenNebula based private clouds. The proposed work has incorporated with semantic based resource description and discovery, capacity based resource selection and resource provisioning mechanism. The proposed framework solves the interoperability between private clouds, enhances the efficiency of cloud resources, increases the scheduling success rate resulting in increase of throughput of application requests submitted to the resource broker in a better manner.","","978-1-4673-1601-9","10.1109/ICRTIT.2012.6206764","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6206764","Semantic;Interoperability;Resource Management;Eucalyptus;Open Nebula;RESTful webservice","Cloud computing;Semantics;Ontologies;Computational modeling;Knowledge based systems","","7","","31","IEEE","31 May 2012","19-21 April 2012","19-21 April 2012","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Especially when the constraints on acceptable response times in services with user interaction are considered, the end-to-end delay becomes an important performance criterion. In this paper, we make an analysis of the processing delay per device and the transmission delay per hop in a heterogeneous smart network.

For self-organizing systems to be able to interact interoperable, the system components must be mapped by uniform digital twins and described in a semantically interoperable manner. Semantic interoperability is implemented in the current research approach of Industrie 4.0 through homogeneous semantics. However, given the large number of different manufacturers of technical components, agreement on uniform semantics seems unlikely. This paper presents a method that extends the Industrie 4.0 approach to heterogeneous semantics. Semantic interoperability is realized through the automated mapping of heterogeneous vocabularies to target semantics. Models from the artificial intelligence sub-field natural language processing are used for automated mapping. In this paper, existing models of natural language processing are compared with each other in terms of their mapping accuracy. A dataset based on the ECLASS standard is being developed as a basis for the comparison. This dataset is also being used to create new models that are fine-tuned to the target vocabulary. The results show that the mapping accuracy of existing approaches improves through fine-tuning by an average of 7.5% up to 93%. In addition to the improvement through fine-tuning, this work analyses the influence of the model size on the mapping accuracy by using large language models. Moreover, it examines the integration of structured knowledge in the form of knowledge graphs.","2378-363X","978-1-6654-9313-0","10.1109/INDIN51400.2023.10218154","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10218154","semantic interoperability;natural language processing;Industrie 4.0","Industries;Vocabulary;Analytical models;Semantics;Process control;Knowledge graphs;Manuals","","6","","48","IEEE","22 Aug 2023","18-20 July 2023","18-20 July 2023","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The current research methods of semantic interoperability generally include standardization, ontology modeling and collaboration templates, each of which has its own internalized limitations. In this paper, a novel cross-context tabular document representation approach (Tabdoc) is proposed, where semantic documents used for cross-domain interaction can maintain the same syntax, concepts, and semantic relations. The new method is implemented under Sign Description Framework (SDF) and an editor is newly developed for semantic document creation.

More than supporting just communication among systems, the interpretation of the interchanged data (semantic interoperability) is a requirement to identify deviations in the grid in time slots as the strict real-time. This paper approach defines a semantic framework which includes a semantic model defined in a powerful ontology language and the proper processing components as the means for interpreting data and for inferencing implicit knowledge.

The Health Information Systems (HIS) that include the DHIS-2 and the silo systems at the present work in isolation, hence the aim of this study is to find a framework that can enable the semantic interoperability of data in such heterogeneous health information systems (HIS). This aim is to allow the DHIS-2 and such silo systems that are in the Namibian public hospitals to work as an integrated platform that can be used to share and exchange important disease-surveillance information. Utilising the Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE) standard, this research guides on how to integrate such heterogeneous health information systems through the adoption of established health standards. Thus, IHE and Health Level Seven (HL7) are adopted to interface DHIS and silo systems specifically at the level of data. An Enterprise Master Index that utilizes the Patient Identification Segment is implemented. The specific aim of this research therefore was to design and develop a framework that is meant for data semantic interoperability of the DHIS and other health information silo systems to enable them to exchange disease-surveillance information. The results of this research are a framework which enables the semantic interoperability of disease surveillance data within Namibian hospitals through the adoption of IHE and HL7 standards in the form of a prototype that demonstrates how disease surveillance data can be integrated in the Namibia environment.","","978-1-5386-3060-0","10.1109/ICABCD.2018.8465439","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8465439","Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise;IHE;Health level Seven;HL7;semantic interoperability;health information systems;disease surveillance;Enterprise Master Patient Index","Standards;Interoperability;Semantics;Information systems;Diseases;Surveillance","","5","","24","IEEE","16 Sep 2018","6-7 Aug. 2018","6-7 Aug. 2018","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

IoT data that belong to users and from which their personal information can be inferred are frequently shared in the background of IoT systems with third parties for experimentation and building quality services. This sharing raises privacy concerns, as in most cases, the data are gathered and shared without the user's knowledge or explicit consent. With the introduction of GDPR, IoT systems and experimentation platforms that federate data from different deployments, testbeds, and data providers must be privacy-preserving. The wide adoption of IoT applications in scenarios ranging from smart cities to Industry 4.0 has raised concerns for the privacy of users' data collected using IoT devices. Inspired by the GDPR requirements, we propose an IoT ontology built using available standards that enhances privacy, enables semantic interoperability between IoT deployments, and supports the development of privacy-preserving experimental IoT applications. We also propose recommendations on how to efficiently use our ontology within a IoT testbed and federating platforms. Our ontology is validated for different quality assessment criteria using standard validation tools. We focus on “experimentation” without loss of generality because it covers scenarios from both research and industry that are directly linked with innovation.","","978-1-6654-9153-2","10.1109/WF-IoT54382.2022.10152206","Science Foundation Ireland(grant numbers:SFI/12/RC/2289_P2); EPSRC(grant numbers:EP/P022529/1,EP/V038087/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10152206","Semantic Interoperability;Privacy;IoT;Best Practices;Testbeds;Experimentation","Technological innovation;Data privacy;Smart cities;Semantics;Buildings;Ontologies;Internet of Things","","5","","29","IEEE","22 Jun 2023","26 Oct.-11 Nov. 2022","26 Oct.-11 Nov. 2022","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The growing capacity of digital documents and electronic objects storage has opened up vast new avenues for the distribution of knowledge in virtual space. This data abundance has made the task of locating relevant knowledge more complex. Such complexity drives the need for intelligent techniques for searching and for knowledge retrieval. The Artificial Intelligence and Semantic Web provide a common framework that allows knowledge to be shared and reused in an efficient way. This paper proposes a new method to gather all these resources and organize so that patrons have everything in one place and able to search and access easily. We propose a comprehensive approach for discovering information objects in large digital collections based on analysis of recorded semantic metadata and the application of artificial intelligence techniques. The work suggests a conceptual architecture for a semantic and intelligent search engine and we also have developed a prototype and tested it for supporting efficient retrieval knowledge from digital libraries.","","978-1-4673-7606-8","10.1109/IntelliSys.2015.7361251","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7361251","formatting;style;styling;insert","Semantics;Libraries;Interoperability;Electronic learning;Semantic Web;Ontologies","","4","","19","IEEE","21 Dec 2015","10-11 Nov. 2015","10-11 Nov. 2015","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, semantic interoperability receives a special attention since it ensures that different health information systems make the same interpretation of the exchanged information. Although several standards have been documented to support interoperability (e.g. HL7 and IHE), achieving the semantic one is still a challenge. In this context, this paper represents a step towards supporting seamless semantic interoperability by combining different health standards (OpenEHR, IHE and HL7). It describes a software architecture that illustrates the role of different health standards in a semantic interoperability environment.

The edge end is responsible for handling customized data processing tasks and transferring the processed data, while the cloud end deals with semantic information processing. Additionally, we present an entity tree embedding algorithm at the cloud end to convert IoT entities and attributes into embedding vectors in a tree-structured way. Consequently, entity embeddings could reflect the semantic information at both Class and Property levels, which ameliorates our previous entity embedding method, leading to better embedding results and clustering effects. Finally, the entity tree embedding algorithm and the corresponding compression algorithm are evaluated. Results indicate that the Whitening algorithm is the best method to compress embedding vectors. More importantly, the entity tree embedding algorithm captures both the semantic and structural information of entities and attributes. Additionally, the clustering experiments show that the proposed embedding algorithm achieves better clustering results compared with the original entity embeddings and the uncompressed averaging method.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2022.3192259","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U2268204,62172061); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2020YFB1711800,2020YFB1707900); Sichuan Province Science and Technology Support Program(grant numbers:2022YFG0155,2022YFG0157,2021GFW019,2021YFG0152,2021YFG0025,2020YFG0322); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9847610","Distributed representation;edge–cloud computing;entity tree embedding;Internet of Everything (IoE);Internet of Things (IoT);interoperability","Semantics;Internet of Things;Interoperability;Distributed databases;Cloud computing;Servers;Scalability","","4","","39","IEEE","2 Aug 2022","15 Feb.15, 2023","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These discrepancies necessitate the introduction of a semantically enriched umbrella framework that will allow DR systems to exchange and consume data transparently, an issue that is currently unaddressed. Furthermore, to support semantically interoperable DR architectures, a multi-layer compliance testing framework is required that will examine and quantify the technical, syntactic and semantic properties of individual DR systems. In this work, the aforementioned gaps in the literature are addressed by, first, introducing an OpenADR-based semantic enrichment component. According to the guidelines of the Smart Grid Architecture Model (SGAM) framework, a concrete evaluation procedure of this component is presented, which allows for a step-by-step syntactic and semantic testing. Following the identification of the instruments composing the testbed and the equipment/links under test at SGAM's communication and information layers, the Basic Application Interoperability Profiles (BAIOPs) are defined and their involved steps are described.

For instance, a port authority deploys smart lighting system, then it implements smart gateways, and in the next stage it decides to combine these two, and a smart container positioning system, into a complete port IoT ecosystem. In the context of interoperability, one of the interesting open issues is: how to manage identities of artifacts and entities that constitute the IoT ecosystem. Identity management seems to be relatively easy in the first case - identifier management can be a part of the IoT deployment. However, as soon as multiple artifacts are to be combined, the problem of identification is no longer easy to solve. This is particularly the case when (i) multiple artifacts originate from different vendors (that use their own identity management approaches), and (ii) when the interoperability solution is based on semantic technologies. In this context, the aim of this contribution is to introduce an approach to identifier management, as well as potential ID interoperability architectures that have been developed within the scope of the INTER-IoT project.","2474-9133","978-1-5386-4328-0","10.1109/ICCW.2018.8403752","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8403752","","Interoperability;Ecosystems;Semantics;Computer architecture;Syntactics;Software;Urban areas","","4","1","14","IEEE","5 Jul 2018","20-24 May 2018","20-24 May 2018","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although it is quite easy to accomplish this within the products of the same brand, it is not facile to provide compatibility for the whole spectrum of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) and the Linked Data (LD) world. Currently, the different applications and devices operate in their own cloud/platform, without supporting sufficient interaction with different vendor-products. As it concerns the meaning of data, which is the main focus of this paper, semantics can settle commonly agreed information models and ontologies for the used terms. However, as there are several ontologies for describing each distinct 'Thing', we need Semantic Mediators (SMs) in order to perform common data mapping across the various utilized formats (i.e. XML or JSON) and ontology alignment (e.g. resolve conflicts). Our goal is to enable end-to-end vertical compatibility and horizontal cooperation at all levels (field/network/backend). Moreover, the implication of security must be taken into consideration as the unsafe adoption of semantic technologies exposes the linking data and the user's privacy, issues that are neglected by the majority of the semantic-web studies. A motivating example of smart sensing is described along with a preliminary implementation on real heterogeneous devices. Two different IoT platforms are integrating in the case study, detailing the main SM features.

The RICORDO effort works closely with modelling communities in the physiology and pharmacology domains to provide a semantic interoperability framework that addresses obstacles to biomedical DMR sharing. The RICORDO framework adopts a core set of community supported standard reference ontologies with which to effect, and reason over, modelling resource metadata. In some cases, knowledge in reference ontologies that is critical to particular interoperability objectives may be incomplete. The specific objective discussed in this paper focuses on the derivation of semantic interoperability between cardiovascular physiology models and related clinical data. In particular, the aim of this work is to semantically infer the anatomical relationship between variables in the Guyton circulatory model and data annotated with vascular disease terms from SNOMED-CT and the International Classification of Disease (ICD-10). The cardiovascular knowledgebase in the Foundational Model of Anatomy (FMA) was curated to provide a more extensive coverage of terms and relations referred to in Guyton model variables and related clinical data. A knowledge representation of cardiovascular connectivity was also developed with which to infer the topological features of the cardiovascular system exported from the curated knowledgebase. This approach allowed the calculation of semantic distance between physiology model variables and disease terms on the basis of their involvement with specific cardiovascular structures. The resulting methodology and associated extended knowledgebase allow the comparison of DMR metadata arising from annotations that conform to the RICORDO ontology standard. In particular, this approach quantifiably and semantically relates physiology and disease concepts annotating mathematical models and clinical data.","","978-1-4673-0026-1","10.1109/eScienceW.2011.29","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6130742","Semantic;Interoperability;Ontologies;Metadata;Reasoning;Cardiovascular;Physiology;Clinical;Modeling","Semantics;Ontologies;Physiology;Biological system modeling;Diseases;Data models","","3","","18","IEEE","16 Jan 2012","5-8 Dec. 2011","5-8 Dec. 2011","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Despite this, the service model is still plagued with several adoption inhibitors, one of which is lack of interoperability between proprietary application infrastructure services of public PaaS solutions. Although there is some progress in addressing the general PaaS interoperability issue through various devised solutions focused primarily on API compatibility, platform-agnostic application design models, interoperability specific to differentiated services provided by the existing public PaaS providers, the resultant disparity owing to the offered services' semantics has not been addressed effectively, yet. The literature indicates that this dimension of PaaS interoperability is awaiting evolution in the state-of-the-art. This paper proposes the initial system design of a PaaS interoperability (IntPaaS) framework to be developed through the integration of semantic, agent technologies to enable transparent interoperability between incompatible PaaS services. This will involve uniform description through semantic annotation of PaaS provider services utilizing the OWL-S ontology, creating a knowledgebase that enables software agents to automatically search for suitable services to support Cloud-based Greenfield application development.

Patients’ data are heterogeneous, divided, and distributed among healthcare organizations. Thus, these data help enhance the quality of healthcare services and improve diagnosis efficiency. Designing an EHR system requires many considerations, such as security, privacy, scalability, integrity, information confidentiality, and interoperability. Healthcare parties involved can internally exchange patient data, but there is an issue in sharing, interpreting, and processing it semantically with other healthcare providers. In this context, blockchain enables the sharing of clinic data in a robust, transparent, and interoperable way between different healthcare providers. It provides secure and scalable sharing of the patient’s health data, expediting coordinated care.

The deployment of a semantic interoperability solution has the potential to enable a wide range of informatics supported applications in clinical care and research both within as ingle healthcare organization and in a network of organizations. At the same time, building and deploying a semantic interoperability solution may require significant effort to carryout data transformation and to harmonize the semantics of the information in the different systems. Our approach to semantic interoperability leverages existing healthcare standards and ontologies, focusing first on specific clinical domains and key applications, and gradually expanding the solution when needed. An important objective of this work is to create a semantic link between clinical research and care environments to enable applications such as streamlining the execution of multi-centric clinical trials, including the identification of eligible patients for the trials. This paper presents an analysis of the suitability of several widely-used medical ontologies in the clinical domain: SNOMED-CT, LOINC, MedDRA, to capture the semantics of the clinical trial eligibility criteria, of the clinical trial data (e.g., Clinical Report Forms), and of the corresponding patient record data that would enable the automatic identification of eligible patients. Next to the coverage provided by the ontologies we evaluate and compare the sizes of the sets of relevant concepts and their relative frequency to estimate the cost of data transformation, of building the necessary semantic mappings, and of extending the solution to new domains. This analysis shows that our approach is both feasible and scalable.","","978-1-4799-7502-0","10.1109/BIBE.2014.12","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7033582","interoperability;medical ontologies;concepts;data transformation;clinical trials;eligiblity criteria;oncology;SNOMED-CT;MedDRA;LOINC","Conferences;Bioinformatics;Biomedical engineering","","2","","9","IEEE","9 Feb 2015","10-12 Nov. 2014","10-12 Nov. 2014","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, various IoT devices generate heterogeneous data in different formats. This hinders IoT devices from integrating and exchanging data between them. Adding semantic web technologies to the Web of Things (WoT) has greatly enabled IoT devices to be semantically interoperable. Moreover, W3C has established a Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) ontology that can be reused in different IoT applications due to difficulties in developing new ontologies. Many systematic mapping reviews in the literature have addressed semantic interoperability in IoT. Although reusability can play a vital role in enhancing semantic interoperability, none of those studies has discussed reusability and semantic interoperability together in the IoT area. In this article, we are seeking to fill this gap in the current literature by conducting a systematic mapping review for 72 articles to point out semantic interoperability as well as reusability in IoT. Five research questions have been identified regarding challenges and possible solutions about both semantic interoperability and reusability. The reviewed articles are classified into four categories. There are 47 articles about semantic interoperability, 2 of which discuss reusability, 18 of which include semantic interoperability with reusability, and the last category includes surveys. Moreover, the research questions are also assigned to the related category that answers the questions. This article highlights important insights about semantic web techniques namely, RDF, ontology, SPARQL, and OWL. Additionally, this article concludes how these techniques are enhanced in diverse domains such as healthcare, smart cities, and the energy domain. On top of that, this systematic mapping shows how reused ontology plays a remarkable role in the IoT domain Finally, results that answer the research questions are figured out and deeply analyzed in the tables and graphs.","","979-8-3315-3149-2","10.1109/IDAP64064.2024.10710911","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10710911","Internet of Things;Semantic Interoperability;Reusability;Reuse Ontology;Semantic Web;Web of Things;Semantic Web of Things","Surveys;Systematics;Reviews;Semantics;W3C;Ontologies;Sensors;Internet of Things;Interoperability;Standards","","1","","51","IEEE","16 Oct 2024","21-22 Sept. 2024","21-22 Sept. 2024","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For several decades, multi-agent systems (MAS) have been used to effectively model and manage energy systems. However, interactions between heterogeneous constituents of such systems remain one of the key challenges. In this paper, we present an approach that enables such components to interoperate seamlessly. The approach is implemented based on SPARQL-Act, a SPARQL-based agent communication language (ACL), to provide a platform-independent ACL. It also manages agents' knowledge bases and handles messages of different performatives. The use of RDF as the content language of exchanged messages and ontologies contributes to the interoperability of agent interactions. The approach was validated in a use case of building energy management of CityLearn. We modelled and implemented a rule-based MAS for optimising the Heating, Ventilation, and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) system of a building. The results show that our proposed solution allows agents to communicate without ambiguity, to manage their knowledge bases, and to interact effectively to achieve their individual as well as the system's objectives.","","979-8-3503-0918-8","10.1109/WI-IAT59888.2023.00073","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10350109","Interoperability;multi-agent system;ontology;semantic web;energy management system","Heating systems;HVAC;Knowledge based systems;Ontologies;Ventilation;Resource description framework;Stakeholders","","1","","22","IEEE","19 Dec 2023","26-29 Oct. 2023","26-29 Oct. 2023","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the diversity of IoT identifier frameworks leads to a heterogeneous set of identifiers. Moreover, these identifiers, often represented as character sequences, lack embedded semantic information. This absence of semantic information hampers the ability of objects with different identifiers to autonomously recognize and collaborate with each other. To address this challenge, we introduce a Semantic Identifier (S-ID) framework designed to bridge the gap between heterogeneous IoT identifiers. The S-ID provides each legacy identifier with a semantic prefix and maps the object to a common IoT ontology. To ensure compatibility with legacy identifiers across multiple frameworks, we develop an algorithm called RHINo (Recognize the frameworks of Heterogeneous Identification Numbers). RHINo employs three novel Identifier-to-Polygon (I2P) transformation strategies and embeds framework-specific information into the S-ID. Based on RHINo, we present a working mechanism to autonomously generate S-IDs and to facilitate intelligent interactions among IoT entities. Our evaluation, conducted on two custom-built datasets, demonstrates that RHINo outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in classification accuracy. A real-world self-service store use-case further substantiates the efficacy of the S-ID as a working mechanism to ensure interoperability among heterogeneous IoT identifiers.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3347586","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10374351","Heterogeneous identifiers recognition;identifier-to-polygon;IoT;interoperability;semantic identifier","Object recognition;Internet of Things;Semantics;Ontologies;Interoperability;Registers;Encoding;Heterogeneous networks","","1","","42","CCBYNCND","26 Dec 2023","2024","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The last layer is dedicated to architecture for semantic interoperability exploiting the first two layers. In this paper, we give more details of information systems interoperability via Semantic Web Services at data level by using and implementing a real case study. It is about trip planning to Japan, which consists of booking airline tickets and hotel rooms. It requires the creation and interaction of several Web services belonging to different information systems and platforms.

In particular, we are interested in the interoperation of an arbitrary set (two or more) of ""legacy"" applications that operate in a common domain, but that were not originally designed to support each other or to share information. To do this, we develop a means to create a general meta-model of the common domain of discourse that contains, organizes and correlates the essential information that each of the applications needs to function as well as any additional information particular to the composed system. This model becomes the basis of communications between the cooperating systems. Each legacy application is able to obtain input data from the model and export output information to augment or update the model in a form that allows cooperating systems to operate on the updated information. We represent the meta-model in RDF/XML which, we believe, provides several important advantages. RDF is a knowledge representation language that allows information to be described as a set of factual sentences. When these sentences are constrained by and consistent with an OWL ontology, this enables the use of an existing, robust collection of automatic reasoners and other logical tools to classify, evaluate, query, apply rules and otherwise operate on the model itself, independently of the cooperating applications. We describe a ""layered"" set of OWL ontologies that serve as domain models for a number of legacy operations analysis simulations, aeronautical engineering design tools and software prototypes that are used to support the integrated design and development of aeronautical systems. We describe an approach to the development of the ontologies that references, and imports concepts from well known foundational ontologies, including DOLCE, GML and PSL. We then describe an example that illustrates a methodology for creating the meta-model as an ""operational scenario"" that indicates the benefits to interoperability of this approach.

In order to achieve this, multiple methods have been proposed to determine semantic maps across concepts from different representations. Previous research has focused on developing different individual matching methods, i.e., ones that compute mapping based on a single matching measure. These efforts assume that some weighted combination can be used to obtain the overall maps. We analyze the problem of combination of multiple individual methods to determine requirements specific to product development and propose a solution approach called FEedback Matching Framework with Implicit Training (FEMFIT). FEMFIT provides the ability to combine the different matching approaches using ranking Support Vector Machine (ranking SVM). The method accounts for nonlinear relations between the individual matchers. It overcomes the need to explicitly train the algorithm before it is used, and further reduces the decision-making load on the domain expert by implicitly capturing the expert's decisions without requiring him to input real numbers on similarity. We apply FEMFIT to a subset of product constraints across a commercial system and the ISO standard. We observe that FEMIT demonstrates better accuracy (average correctness of the results) and stability (deviation from the average) in comparison with other existing combination methods commonly assumed to be valid in this domain.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2011.2171950","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6074968","Concept matching;product lifecycle management (PLM);ranking support vector machine (SVM);semantic interoperability","Semantics;Support vector machines;Vectors;Product development;Training;Design automation;Software","","1","","24","IEEE","9 Nov 2011","April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the variety of ways that a domain can be conceptualized results in the creation of different ontologies with discrepancies and heterogeneities. As a consequence, an ontology alignment process is necessary for bridging this gap and achieving a full communication understanding across different software components. This paper uses a synergetic approach, based on the integration of collaborative agents and parallel memetic algorithms, for efficiently aligning ontologies and, consequently, solving the semantic heterogeneity problem. As shown by a statistical procedure, our approach yields high performance in terms of the ratio between alignment quality and computational effort with respect to conventional evolutionary approaches for ontology alignment.","","978-1-4673-5881-1","10.1109/IA.2013.6595185","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6595185","","Ontologies;Biological cells;Memetics;Interoperability;Semantics;Collaboration;Pragmatics","","1","","18","IEEE","12 Sep 2013","16-19 April 2013","16-19 April 2013","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

SENIO is based on security-related ontologies that are designed to describe security properties of web services, which can be specific, by stating the particular standards/protocols supported, or more general, such as the security mechanisms used and the credentials required. The security properties associated with registered web services as well as requests for web services are security requirements and capabilities.

Agriculture exploits natural spaces and resources for useful production to humans. Soil is the primary source of nutrients for the plants. The roots absorb nutrient ions from soil and water. Additional nutrients must be mixed in the soil before the cultivation begins. Use of excess chemicals has adverse effects both on the crop and the environment. Optimal amount of nutrient requirement must be met for maximum yield. This paper presents a crop selection criteria based on K-nearest neighbour algorithm. The proposed method used farm inputs like soil type, climate, micronutrients, macronutrients, water source etc. to select the best crop suited for the farm. The algorithm also provides the amount of deficient nutrients required for the crop production. This methodology can be integrated into a semantic interoperability framework for Internet of Things (IoT) based applications. The proposed method accurately estimated the crop needs and the corresponding quantity of the nutrient necessary and sufficient to achieve a production objective defined by the yield.","","978-93-80544-43-4","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9441275","agrosystems;K-nearest neighbour;soil nutrients;maximum yield;Internet of Things;sematic interoperability","Semantics;Production;Soil;Predictive models;Prediction algorithms;Agriculture;Internet of Things","","","","24","","3 Jun 2021","17-19 March 2021","17-19 March 2021","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing IoT solutions often function as isolated “data silos”, impeding the seamless integration of heterogeneous data sources crucial for informed decision-making and streamlined processes. This research addresses this issue by introducing a pioneering solution: the semantic interoperability support system (SISS). SISS is an innovative tool designed to bridge the semantic divide between disparate data models within a common application domain. To address the lack of interoperability between current IoT platforms, devices, and solutions that use native data models, SISS facilitates integration by enabling the generation of gateways or translator components. These components establish mappings between the semantic properties of source and target data models, leveraging advanced semantic analysis and inference techniques. The core principle underpinning SISS is its ability to discern and map the semantic content of data models. Through a meticulous analysis of the temporal and spatial dimensions inherent in the data, SISS establishes meaningful connections. This innovative approach fosters interoperability and enables a deeper understanding of the underlying information, enhancing the potential for data-driven insights. This article delves into the pervasive issue of semantic interoperability in the current IoT paradigm and presents SISS as a transformative solution. By emphasizing its ability to transcend the limitations of existing solutions and its methodology to generate mappings between disparate data models, this research contributes to the achievement of global semantic interoperability in IoT.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2025.3577776","DEMETER Project through INDUSTRIAL LEADERSHIP—Leadership in enabling and Industrial Technologies-Information and Communication Technologies (ICT)(grant numbers:857202); ICT receives support from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program, and Italy, Luxembourg, Spain, Germany, Greece, United Kingdom, Norway, Czechia, Montenegro, Belgium, Romania, Ireland, Finland, Serbia, Portugal, Poland, Georgia, and Slovenia; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11028910","Big data;data science;Internet of Things (IoT);machine learning (ML);precision agriculture;semantic interoperability","Internet of Things;Interoperability;Data models;Semantics;Syntactics;Protocols;Ontologies;Translation;Quality of service;Biological system modeling","","","","66","CCBYNCND","9 Jun 2025","15 Aug.15, 2025","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Ontologies, which are semantic representations of knowledge, are built to provide semantic interoperability. However, the diversity of applications and the scope of new technologies makes current ontology's proposals incomplete in modeling privacy and security, energy awareness, and ethics at the same time. In this context, we propose an enhanced Ontology, called IoTO++, for improving semantic interoperability in IoT environments. We validated the proposal considering lexical, structural and domain knowledge levels. Results show that even though lite ontologies are more maintainable, compatible and transferable, ontologies with more annotations are better in terms of functional adequacy.

Without interoperability, DTs remain isolated and cannot share validated knowledge or build upon each other's operational experience. Semantic interoperability is therefore essential for supporting communication, parameter adaptation, and collaborative improvement across multiple DTs. This paper presents a layered framework that achieves semantic interoperability by leveraging W3C-aligned standards, together with shapes constraint language validation and rule-based reasoning. It integrates a semantic gateway, a knowledge graph, and a rule engine to support consistent data integration, semantic representation, and decision support. It also incorporates a DT interface that exposes validated observations and action logs to external DTs under a shared data contract, thereby enabling cross-twin communications. The framework's effectiveness is demonstrated using simulated electrolyzer stack temperature and pressure observations, which confirm correct ingestion, validation, and semantic representation of plant data. A twin-to-twin communication scenario further illustrates how hydrogen DTs can exchange validated knowledge, adapt operational parameters, and support collective learning. Results show that the framework reduces integration complexity and provides diagnostics for non-conforming data, thereby supporting reliable and semantically interoperable DT operations.","","979-8-3315-3739-5","10.1109/ISGTMiddleEast65737.2025.11314206","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11314206","Digital Twin;Semantic Interoperability;Hydrogen Power Plants;Knowledge Graph","Semantics;Hydrogen;Knowledge graphs;Logic gates;Cognition;Digital twins;Reliability;Interoperability;Power generation;Engines","","","","17","IEEE","2 Jan 2026","23-26 Nov. 2025","23-26 Nov. 2025","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, such Iot-enhanced BPs, do not usually operated with the low-level data that is generated by such devices. Within this context, Complex Event Processing (CEP) systems are commonly integrated with BP engines to properly execute such Iot-enhanced BPs. However, IoT devices are heterogeneous by nature and CEP systems need to manage a technology heterogeneity in the data that make its processing a difficult task. In the same way, the myriad of technology solutions that exist for BP engines usually led to the creation of integration solutions that couple the CEP system with the integration API provided by a specific engine. All these issues make it difficult to adapt the system if technology requirements change. To facilitate decoupled interoperability among BP engines, CEP systems, and IoT devices in this paper we propose an architecture based on microservices, ontologies, and event-based communication which allows us to design a common communication model that is independent of technology. Specifically we propose. As a proof of concept, we have developed a tool to test and support the proposal against specific changes on technological requirements.","2472-7571","979-8-3503-1222-5","10.1109/IE57519.2023.10179096","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10179096","iot;business processes;microservices;events;interoperability","Semantics;Microservice architectures;Ontologies;Real-time systems;Internet of Things;Proposals;Task analysis","","","","24","IEEE","14 Jul 2023","29-30 June 2023","29-30 June 2023","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While for internally provided IT services guidelines and standards for the IT management exist, the IT management must be further supported by integrating management aspects of external IT services. Based on our previous concept of the inter-organizational Configuration Management Database, in this article, we concentrate on an ontology-based solution for the problem of heterogeneity issues caused by the autonomy in modeling CMDB contents in each of the observed IT service provider organizations. Our concept delivers a stepwise approach to handle semantic mismatches and is based on a hybrid Ontology mapping. Besides solving the heterogeneity of the service providers' management information systems and offering a holistic view of the overall IT infrastructure to the IT management, semantic mechanisms additionally allow to retrieve knowledge in an automated manner.","1573-0077","978-3-901882-50-0","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6573168","","Ontologies;Organizations;OWL;Semantics;Standards organizations;Object oriented modeling;Conferences","","","","32","","1 Aug 2013","27-31 May 2013","27-31 May 2013","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While STANAG 4586 provides NATO-compliant interoperability, it is often complex and resource-intensive for smaller UAVs, whereas MAVLink is lightweight and widely adopted but lacks robust security features. JAUS, in turn, offers modularity but introduces challenges in semantic consistency. This paper proposes an ontology-based semantic interoperability framework to bridge these protocols, enabling unified command, control, and telemetry integration. The ontology leverages formal representation of UAV platforms, sensors, commands, and telemetry messages, ensuring semantic alignment across heterogeneous systems. Protocol mapping is supported through ontology object properties that capture message equivalences and context dependencies. The proposed framework also incorporates semantic concepts derived from EUROSUR and CISE to extend interoperability towards maritime security and border surveillance applications. Case studies demonstrate mapping of representative commands and telemetry (e.g., TakeOffCommand, Waypoint navigation) across protocols. This ontology-based approach improves semantic consistency, reduces integration complexity, and supports multi-domain UAV operations.","","979-8-3315-8704-8","10.1109/SMAP66932.2025.00037","Visa; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11309809","Ontology;UAV;Interoperability;STANAG 4586;JAUS;MAVLink;Semantic Web;EUROSUR;CISE","Protocols;Social networking (online);Surveillance;Semantics;Ontologies;Autonomous aerial vehicles;Sensors;Telemetry;Security;Interoperability","","","","12","IEEE","31 Dec 2025","27-28 Nov. 2025","27-28 Nov. 2025","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For autonomous receivers and sources sharing a common subject domain, the mediator's reasoning engine can devise query plans integrating multiple sources and resolving semantic heterogeneity. Receiver applications obtain the data they need in the form they need it without imposing changes on sources. The KR architecture includes: 1) data models for each source and receiver, 2) subject domain ontologies, containing abstract subject matter conceptualizations that would be known to experienced practitioners in the industry, and 3) context models for each source and receiver that explain how each source or receiver data model implements the abstract concepts from a subject domain ontology.

IVERSITY of representation of data, formats, and terminologies make it difficult to match up and analyze data. In the light of these challenges, there is a proposed solution called the OntologyDriven Semantic Interoperability Framework which applies definitive ontologies of the domain to achieve the interlinking of health data. It thus facilitates data sharing across the different institutions, and also ensures that the data is consistent and can be interpreted in the same way. This component of our approach is called the graph-based query analysis where graph database and query optimization techniques are used to improve the efficiency of the data retrieval process. Our approach also effectively represents healthcare entities and their relationships as a knowledge graph to support human-controllable queries and various semantic reasoning. Moreover, for an automated matching of the different data sets to a common conceptual schema we employ machine learning techniques to automatically map various sources of input to the created ontology. The proposed framework facilitates the access of data, enables researchers and clinicians to make more-informed decisions and helps in big science in the biomedical field. Experimental analysis prove that arsenal is efficient in comparing to traditional relational databases in terms of execution of queries' time and their accuracy. Our work reveals that using the approaches based on ontology can effectively eliminate the issues of semantic mismatch and will contribute to the development of an intelligent environment for healthcare.","","979-8-3315-3853-8","10.1109/COMP-SIF65618.2025.10969920","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10969920","Semantic Interoperability;Ontology;Healthcare Big Data;Graph-Based Query Analysis;Knowledge Graphs;Data Integration","Terminology;Query processing;Semantics;Medical services;Knowledge graphs;Ontologies;Big Data;Cognition;Sustainable development;Interoperability","","","","15","IEEE","28 Apr 2025","21-22 March 2025","21-22 March 2025","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Their extensive applications in electronic health records, clinical decision support systems, and research underscore their critical role in managing complex healthcare data. However, heterogeneity among independently developed ontologies introduces challenges that hinder efficient knowledge integration and interoperability. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework, Hierarchical Embedding for Ontology Matching (HEOM), based on hierarchical embedding techniques. The method captures structural, semantic, and contextual relationships, ensuring effective alignment of complex ontologies. By preserving hierarchical dependencies, HEOM improves the robustness and scalability of semantic interoperability in health-care systems. Our experiments, conducted using benchmark datasets from the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI), demonstrate significant improvements in precision, recall, and F-measure, highlighting the framework’s potential to advance intelligent and interoperable healthcare systems.","2576-3555","979-8-3315-0338-3","10.1109/CoDIT66093.2025.11321357","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11321357","Medical Ontologies;Ontology Matching;Hierarchical Embeddings;Semantic Interoperability;Healthcare Systems","Decision support systems;Accuracy;Terminology;Scalability;Semantics;Medical services;Ontologies;Benchmark testing;Robustness;Interoperability","","","","22","IEEE","14 Jan 2026","15-18 July 2025","15-18 July 2025","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
