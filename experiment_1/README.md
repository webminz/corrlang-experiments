# Experiment 1

This second experiment is a bit more "open" than the previous one.
Here, there is no strict "expected" result. 
You are free to explore different possibilities to align the 
two schemas in this example, maybe there are more than one solution?!

Try writing various `identify` statements, observe the ouput, and reflect about the following:
- How do you decide whether two or more elements should be matched?
- What is the importance of data when matching schemas/models?
- How important are visualization when doing semantic matching?
- Are there some technical issues you encounter?
